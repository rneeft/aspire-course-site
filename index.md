# Welcome to the Microservices Course with .NET Aspire

This website is the central hub for the **Microservices course with .NET Aspire**.

In this course, we build a simplified version of the **COV solution**. COV stands for **Controle op Verzekeringsgegevens** (Insurance Data Check). It is an application where health insurers upload their health insurance data. Healthcare providers use this software to check the health insurance status of their patients.

Explore the materials, follow the workshops, and learn how to design and implement microservices using .NET Aspire!
