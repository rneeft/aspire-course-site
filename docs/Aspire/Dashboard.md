Let's zoom in on the Aspire Dashboard.

## Resources

The Resources section of the Aspire Dashboard displays all the services and dependencies that are part of your distributed application. This includes APIs, databases, message queues, and other resources. You can view the status of each resource, see if they are healthy, and access useful links such as endpoints and dashboards. This section allows you to monitor and manage the lifecycle of your application's components.

## Console (logs)

The Console (logs) section shows real-time logs from your running services. You can use this view to monitor application output, debug issues, and track the behavior of your services as they run. It provides a centralized place to see logs from all components in your Aspire solution.

## Structured Log
