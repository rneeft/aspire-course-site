# Next Steps

Now that we've explored the current solution, it's clear that the system is handling too many responsibilities within a single application. This can lead to challenges in scalability, maintainability, and deployment.

The next step is to introduce **.NET Aspire**, a platform designed to help manage and orchestrate microservice architectures. With .NET Aspire, we can break down the monolithic system into smaller, focused services, making it easier to develop, deploy, and scale each part of the application independently.

In the following sections, we'll see how [.NET Aspire](../Aspire/) can simplify the transition to a microservices-based architecture and improve the overall structure of the system.
